            <p>Dear Admissions Committee, 

                I hope this finds you well! I would like to thank you for a wonderful interview day, which has absolutely confirmed that SUNY Upstate is my first choice for a medical education. I continue to be drawn to the warmth and kindness of the Upstate community, which was echoed robustly by students, faculty and staff throughout the interview day. 
                
                My diverse life experiences, including working on a rural farm and caregiving for an elderly woman, have solidified my commitment to becoming a rural primary care physician in Upstate New York, with a special focus on palliative medicine, elder care, and the delivery of care in rural areas. Throughout the interview day I was so excited to continue learning about the many opportunities at Upstate that nurture this goal, particularly the Rural Medical Scholars Program and the Longitudinal Clinical Preceptorship.
